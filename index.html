    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> I would first enlighten them on different security threats to understand why they would need good and trustworthy protection against it. After that I would advise them to take necessary steps such as sanitization of data, secure authorization and authentication and to make use of well-known third-party applications. And off course always do good research on the different methods beforehand to provide the best security possible. </p>
